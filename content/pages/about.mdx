I'm studying Systems Engineering at [UTN](https://www.utn.edu.ar), a 5-year degree with a strong emphasis on software engineering, and I expect to graduate at the end of next year.

I like working with **Machine Learning, Data Science, and Software Engineering**.

In the past, I started a retail business called [ROHI Sommiers](https://rohisommiers.com) with my mom and helped it grow for 4 years. Now, it operates with custom software that I've developed to manage its logistics using Next.js, PostgreSQL and Auth0.
