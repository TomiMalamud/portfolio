description: Some things about me 
---
I'm a **Systems Engineering student** at [Universidad Tecnológica Nacional (UTN)](https://utn.edu.ar), on track to graduate in 2025, and I'm also working on my entrepreneurial ventures in Villa Carlos Paz, Córdoba, Argentina.

I'm actively seeking an internship or an **entry-level job** that encourages growth and innovation. With hands-on experience in **front-end development**, full-stack web apps, and static websites, I'm eager to join a team that prioritizes collaboration and cutting-edge technology.

One of my proudest achievements is the **business I co-founded** with my mom, called [ROHI Sommiers](https://rohisommiers.com). Starting from scratch, we've expanded to three physical stores, a nationwide e-commerce website, and a strong presence on **Mercado Libre**. I've recruited, onboarded, and managed a team that grew to 10 members, and we currently have 5 employees.

### My Skills
- SQL (advanced), Python (advanced)
- Next.js/React (intermediate), PostgreSQL (intermediate), Django (intermediate)
- Torch/PyTorch (beginner), Deep Learning (beginner)

I've also built projects using an **Object-Oriented Programming** paradigm in Python using Django.

My focus lately has been on exploring areas like Deep Learning, AI advancements, Open Source, and the intricate craft of **engaging frontend experiences**. I'm committed to **building useful software products**, some of which you can find described on [this page](/). Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect.

I draw inspiration from great thinkers such as:
    - [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/) for entrepreneurial wisdom.
    - [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) for cutting-edge AI and ML insights.
    - [Andrew Huberman](https://www.hubermanlab.com/) for his captivating neuroscientific research.
    - [Warren Buffett](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/) for timeless and contrarian investment principles.
    - [Guillermo Rauch](https://rauchg.com/) for innovative frontend development ideas.

I'd recommend anyone to check out their work.
