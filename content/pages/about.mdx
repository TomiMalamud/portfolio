description: Some things about me 
---

I'm studying Systems Engineering at [Universidad Tecnológica Nacional (UTN)](https://utn.edu.ar) and plan to graduate in 2025. At the same time, I'm running a business in Villa Carlos Paz, Córdoba, Argentina.

**I'm looking for an entry-level role** where I can grow and try new things. I have experience in front-end development, full-stack applications, and creating easy-to-use websites.

### A Business I Started

I'm proud of [ROHI Sommiers](https://rohisommiers.com), a business I started with my mom. We've grown from a small shop to three physical stores and an online store that sells all over the country. We're also on Mercado Libre. I've led a team of up to 10 people, and we now have five dedicated employees.

### Skill Set

- SQL, Python (**Advanced**)
- Next.js/React, PostgreSQL, Django (**Intermediate**)
- Torch/PyTorch, Deep Learning (**Beginner**)

I've also built projects using an Object-Oriented Programming paradigm in Python using Django.

### Current Focus

These days, I'm learning more about Deep Learning, AI, Open Source, and fine-tuning the **user experience on the front end**. I'm committed to building *useful software products*, some of which you can find described on [this page](/).
