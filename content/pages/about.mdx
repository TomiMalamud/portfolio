description: Some things about me 
---

I'm from CÃ³rdoba, Argentina, and I study Systems Engineering at [UTN](https://www.utn.edu.ar), a 5-year degree focused on software engineering. I expect to graduate by the end of next year.

I enjoy reading and building things related to **Machine Learning, Data Science, and Software Engineering**.

In 2024, I joined Renault Group, contributing to the research and early development of a predictive maintenance system using data from over 34 [spot welding robots](https://www.fanucamerica.com/solutions/applications/welding-robots/spot-welding-robots).

In 2019, I co-founded [ROHI Sommiers](https://rohisommiers.com), a retail business, with my mom. Over four years, I helped it grow and developed custom software for managing operations, built with Next.js, PostgreSQL, and Auth.js.
