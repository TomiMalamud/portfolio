description: Some things about me

I'm from CÃ³rdoba, Argentina, and I study **Systems Engineering** at [UTN](https://www.utn.edu.ar), a 5-year degree. I expect to graduate by the end of this year.

Now working as a **Software Engineer** at [Soundlink](https://getsoundlink.com/ads).

In 2024, I joined Renault Group, contributing to the research and development of a predictive maintenance system for more than 34 [spot welding robots](https://www.fanucamerica.com/solutions/applications/welding-robots/spot-welding-robots).

In 2019, I co-founded [ROHI Sommiers](https://rohisommiers.com), a retail business, with my mom. Over four years, I helped it grow and developed an OMS for managing operations, built with Next.js and Supabase.
