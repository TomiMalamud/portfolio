description: Some things about me 
---

I'm studying Systems Engineering at [UTN](https://www.utn.edu.ar), a 5-year degree with a strong emphasis on software engineering, and I expect to graduate at the end of next year.

I have experience with Machine Learning, Data Science and Software Engineering. I've built several [projects](/#projects) like a movie recommendation system, a file conversion service, and a full-stack web app.

I've led a retail business for 4 years. Now, it operates with custom software that I've developed to manage its logistics using Auth0, Next.js and PostgreSQL.


### A Business I Started

I'm proud of [ROHI Sommiers](https://rohisommiers.com), a business I started with my mom. We've grown from a small shop to three physical stores and an online store that sells all over the country. We're also on Mercado Libre. I've led a team of up to 10 people, and we now have five dedicated employees.

### Skill Set

- SQL, Python (**Advanced**)
- Next.js/React, PostgreSQL, Django (**Intermediate**)
- Torch/PyTorch, Deep Learning (**Beginner**)

I've also built projects using an Object-Oriented Programming paradigm in Python using Django.

### Current Focus

These days, I'm learning more about Deep Learning, AI, Open Source, and fine-tuning the **user experience on the front end**. I'm committed to building *useful software products*, some of which you can find described on [this page](/).
