description: Some things about me

I'm studying Systems Engineering at [UTN](https://www.utn.edu.ar), a 5-year degree with a strong emphasis on software engineering, and I expect to graduate at the end of next year.

I love working with Machine Learning, Data Science and Software Engineering. I've built several [projects](/#projects) like a movie recommendation system called [Altas Pelis](https://altaspelis.com/), a file conversion service, and a full-stack web app.

I've led a retail business for 4 years. Now, it operates with custom software that I've developed to manage its logistics using Auth0, Next.js and PostgreSQL.


### A Business I Started

I'm proud of [ROHI Sommiers](https://rohisommiers.com), a business I started with my mom. We've grown from a small store to two stores and an online store that sells all over the country. We're also on Mercado Libre, the largest online marketplace in Latin America. I've led a team of up to 10 people, and we now have five dedicated employees.
