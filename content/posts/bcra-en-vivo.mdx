BCRA en Vivo makes Central Bank data accessible to both professionals and non-professionals. It displays real-time and historical interactive charts, allows comparisons with previous periods and trends, and also provides access to the debtors' registry.

## BCRA Statistics

It includes interactive visualizations of *all* public economic, monetary, and exchange rate data from the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA). It is accessible for non-professionals while also offering tools designed for economists, analysts, and journalists.

ðŸ“Š It features charts that can be filtered by period, compared with previous periods, exported to CSV, displayed in different visual formats depending on the data type, and more.

For example, here is the inflation rate from 03/30/2024 to 01/30/2025, compared to the previous year. The dotted lines represent the comparison:

Additionally, not everyone is fully aware of what each variable means. Some variables, such as "Housing Unit (UVI) (in pesos -with two decimals-, base 03/31/2016=14.05)," may be unfamiliar to many. You can also ask **ChatGPT** a quick question to understand them:

## Debtors' Registry

The BCRA debtors' registry generates a consolidated report by CUIT/CUIL, according to its official documentation: "regarding financing granted by financial entities, financial trusts, non-financial entities issuing credit/purchase cards, other non-financial credit providers, reciprocal guarantee companies, public guarantee funds, and credit service providers among individuals through platforms."

It also allows users to view their **bounced checks** and historical credit status:

And also the evolution of the total debt amount.

This way, anyone can access the official BCRA information with a more user-friendly interface and additional tools.

I am planning to add some tools for generating custom reports in the future.
