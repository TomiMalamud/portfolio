A project built with cutting-edge web development technologies:

<Badge variant="vercel" />, a frontend cloud platform. I've also used **Vercel Postgres** to store the data.

<Badge variant="next" />, an open-source web framework built with react

<Badge variant="prisma" /> an ORM to work with databases in a efficient way.
 
Other technologies like [Auth0](https://auth0.com)'s Universal Login, [ShadcnUI](https://ui.shadcn.com) UI components and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) helped me to develop this project.
