Try it out [here](https://altaspelis.com/).

This is a very fast movie recommendation system using the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org) API.
It has around 10,000 movies!

The similar movies are calculated using the [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) algorithm based on genres, cast, directors, and keywords. Ranking is very simple; it's just the count of votes on IMDb.

It also uses the TMDB API and JustWatch API to get the streaming availability of movies for specific regions.
