Altas Pelis is a content-based **movie recommendation system** designed to find movies similar to the user's favorites. It uses Sentence Transformers to generate embeddings for each movie based on its details and calculates cosine similarity on the fly for recommendations.

It also shows **where to watch** the movie! (for Argentina)

The dataset includes over 10,000 movies, combining data from IMDb (directors, ratings, cast) and TMDB (overviews, posters, backdrops, keywords, production countries).

It was a lot of fun to build. I stored the embeddings of the movies' data in a .npy file (a NumPy array, very simple), and that's essentially how it recommends movies—by computing cosine similarity when you select a movie.

The system is built with Next.js for the frontend and Flask for the backend, which provides endpoints for search, recommendations, and movie details.

I've published the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/TomiMalamud/altaspelis).
