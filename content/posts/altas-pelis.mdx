Altas Pelis is a movie recommendation system that helps you find movies similar to ones you already enjoy. It works across all streaming platforms (like Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, etc.), making it easier to discover new films regardless of where they're available.


I've also published some of the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/TomiMalamud/altaspelis).

## How It Works

1. **Movie Database**: I built a dataset of over 10,000 movies by combining information from IMDb (movie details, directors, ratings, cast) and TMDB (overviews, taglines, posters, backdrops, keywords).

2. **Similarity Calculation**: The app uses a cosine similarity matrix based on genres, cast, directors, and keywords to find similar movies. This matrix is converted to a sparse format for efficient storage and quick access.

3. **Stack**:
   - Frontend: Built with Next.js
   - Backend: Flask server providing endpoints for movie search, recommendations, and movie details
   - Data Storage: All movie data and similarity information is stored in NumPy arrays

4. **Performance**: The use of sparse matrices and NumPy arrays allows for fast, memory-efficient operation, even with a large dataset.

Altas Pelis is a simple tool designed to make movie discovery easier, faster and more enjoyable across different streaming services.
