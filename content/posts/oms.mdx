**ROHI Sommiers** is a mattress retailer with three stores and an e-commerce platform. Most orders are delivered to customers' homes, requiring coordination for mattress pickups from suppliers' factories and ensuring stores are properly stocked while keeping the ERP's recorded inventory accurate.

Previously, operations relied on disorganized shared Google Sheets, leading to inefficiencies, lost employee time, frequent customer complaints, and unnecessary overpayments to outsourced carriers handling deliveries.

This new, lean solution significantly streamlined operations by:  
- Synchronizing manufacturing orders and supplier balances with ERP data.  
- Implementing role-based access control, ensuring employees only access relevant information, with restricted interactions and activity logs.  
- Tracking sales targets and bonuses per employee.  
- Optimizing home deliveries and in-store pickups.  
- Accurately tracking mattress pickups to prevent overcharges from carriers.  
- Properly reflecting internal stock movements between stores in the ERP.  
- Storing a database for carriers.  
- Managing product pricing, discounts, and financing.  
- Tracking manufacturing orders and their balances, with direct communication with suppliers.

## Results  
- **50% reduction** in operational costs related to deliveries, manufacturing orders, suppliers, and carriers.  
- **2x increase** in the ratio of 5-star reviews to sales.  
- **90% decrease** in operational errors.

## Stack  
- Next.js for frontend and backend  
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) for authentication, database, and storage  
- Vercel for deployment
